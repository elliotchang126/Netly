# Netly
Making networking better

## Goal

Netly's goal is to improve networking. While LinkedIn is a great way to build networks, users can be overwhelmed by the the scope of it. Real connections tend to be build one on one, so we seek to improve networking with this goal. People are more than their careers, with vastly different hobbies and interests. Why not connect based on those similarities! To put it simply, think Tinder for networking. While various apps like Bumble have expanded their core functionality to include this, we find that they could be improved. That's why Netly was created, to make networking better.

It's still early on, but we invite you to monitor our progress, and when we launch on the app store please give it a shot!
